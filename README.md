implement the code present in the research paper.
enhance the detection using IoT.
Research for the interpatient classification.
Improve the accuracy.
with DAE features and SVM classifier, the accuracy achieved was more but accuracy can be increased. The main problem for this is, will it be lightweight?
The main motto of the given research paper is to develop a lightweight model, our motto is to implement the model with the help of IoT where anyone can just connect to the server and predict the disease.
